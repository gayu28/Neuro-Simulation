 TouchSim which predicts the responses from given stimulus. In our work, we would want to predict the responses(frequency) from stimulus. 'Firing Rate', 'Spikes', 'Afferent_Class' can be taken as input. Kindly, look into it and let me know your requirements like tuning the dataset with different values or anything else. 

1. TouchSim- Existing Work: This is the base model. You can take a look into touchsim/classes.py, where responses(firing rate and Spikes) are generated from stimulus(frequency). If required, you can look into touchsim-demo.ipynb for better understanding.
